NAME
    python3 olympics.py - print entries from olympics psql database

SYPNOPSIS
    python3 olympics.py <OPTION> [<SEARCH_STRING>] 


DESCRIPTION
    Print out the database entries that matches the provided OPTION.

    NOTE: 
        If multiple flags are provided, ALL outputs will be printed (e.g. running -n and -m flags at once will print out athletes from noc AND medals earned per noc)

        Print order is predetermined (e.g. using -n followed by -m flag will have the same result as using -m followed by -n flag). Order will always be NOC --> Medals --> Athletes

        The only exception is the -h / --help flag, where it'll simply bring up this usage document  
    
    -n, --noc  
    
        NOTE: this option will ONLY search based on NOC's abbreviated name / IOC (e.g. searching for NOC 'Singapore' will return nothing, but searching for 'SGP' will print out a list of athletes)

        NOTE: this option will ONLY research string that fully matches (e.g., you can not search for ALL NOC that contain the character 's')

        print all athletes from provided NOC, sorted by alphabetical order by last name
    
    -m, --medals 

        NOTE: this flag does not take in an argument

        print ALL nocs and the numbers of gold medals they've won, sorted by number of gold medals earned in decreasing order 
    
    -a, --athletes

        NOTE: athletes will be printed in alphabetical order

        print ALL athletes with names that contains the provided argument and the number of gold medals they've won. 

        
    -h, --help 
        print this usage statement
